Hi everyone, my name is Charles Bao, I'm a second year Computer Science student here at UC Santa Barbara, and I use he/him/his pronouns. I am an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for CS 40 for this Spring quarter, and although this is my first quarter as a ULA, I'm really excited to be one and to work with students.

Part of the reason I wanted to be a ULA was because in my free time I mentor a high school robotics team. I used to be a member on my old high school's competitive robotics team (shout out to any other FRC or FIRST alums), and it was a really fun experience and so I decided to go  back, and become a mentor where I teach basic Java to new members, help guide students through the debugging process, and help the software team plan out new code for the robot. Helping students work through software issues and teaching them new concepts like time complexity has been some of the most enjoyable and rewarding experiences in my life, especially when their faces light up after they figure out something that they’ve been stuck on for hours.

One interesting fact about me is that the majority of my close friends call me Chuckles because someone randomly gave me that nickname back in sixth grade and it has stuck with me ever since then. No one knows who that someone is, and no one knows why they decided to call me that but most of my friends agree that its because I laugh a lot and also because I’m obnoxious.

In my free time, I enjoy spending an unhealthy amount of time scrolling on Twitter and Tik Tok, watching and then re-watching shows on Netflix or Disney+, and napping for absurd amounts of time.
