Hello! My name is Sophia Cheng and I’m currently a second year newly transferred Computer Science major (as of this spring). I originally came in as a physics major but I ended up taking more classes in the data science/computer science track from the start. In previous classes I did not shy away from attending office hours or open lab and I was really appreciative of all the help that I got from the ULAs, TAs, and professors. I actually did not know that ULAs were undergraduates until the day that I applied. I was under the impression that everyone was a graduate student until I found one of my old ULAs on LinkedIn and saw the position listed. A very fortunate coincidence considering this is what led me to learn more about it and apply on my own the same day! I look forward to being on the opposite side of the situation to learn and teach as a ULA.

I think that discrete math is an important building block for higher level math and computer science. It is a way to challenge traditional thinking and creates a new environment to test theories and algorithms. As a ULA, I hope to help make learning enjoyable but challenging. It is good to learn both individually as well as with others. Whether it is working with friends or asking questions to the ULAs, I hope that office hours and section will provide this opportunity.

I really enjoy art, both consuming it and producing it, and am considering a double major in art or art history. Come talk to me about questions or suggestions for art classes at UCSB! During my free time I try to draw and paint, but it's mostly just been drawing in the margins of my notes and homework. I’ve taught art in the past but never CS, so I’m interested to see how different or similar the two are.
