Hi everyone, my name is Charles Bao, I'm a second year Computer Science student here at UC Santa Barbara, and I use he/him/his pronouns. A fun fact about me is that I like to collect weird and funny socks even though I sadly lost a couple pairs of them back when I was living in the dorms at UCSB. I currently am a mentor for a high school competitive robotics team that I used to be a member of. As a mentor, I help the members on the team debug their robot's code and sometimes I also help guide them through the process of developing new code for the robot. Mentoring my old robotics team has been an experience that I have really thoroughly enjoyed especially when I get to see the students' faces light up when they finally figure something out after they've been stuck on it for hours. Because of my good experiences from mentoring at my old robotics team, I figured that if I really enjoyed helping high schoolers with their code, I might as well take a stab at helping college students learn Computer Science. Personally, Iâ€™m excited to be a ULA for CS 40 because I actually struggled a bit when I took it, but I found the class to be really rewarding when you figure out the concepts and really see the math behind some of the really important fundamental concepts in Computer Science. I hope that the students that take CS 40 this quarter will enjoy it and will learn a lot from the course just like I did. I hope that I get to help some students reach that lightbulb moment where they make a breakthrough to understand a problem and I also hope to enjoy being a ULA as much as I have enjoyed mentoring my hold robotics team.
