Welcome to CS9! My name is Brice Redmond and I am a fourth year computer science and economics major. I'm super excited to help you guys learn intermediate python. 
Python is a super useful skill for pretty much every discipline. The flexibility, ease of use and widespread adoption of python are unparalleled. My goal for this class
is that students feel that they are in an environment where they are hitting minimal road blocks and learning a lot. Because of that, I hope that you all feel comfortable
coming to office hours and lab sections and asking any questions that may be tripping you up.

I started programming when I was a sophomore in High School at a Stanford coding camp. Since then, I have spent time creating games, iOS and android apps, and web apps. 
I am most interested in Web Development though, particularly the Devops side of things. Devops stands for developer operations and is the computer science discipline
focused on making the development experience for the other developers as easy as possible, as well as ensuring systems reliability and speed.
I am currently doing part time with Novacoast to help them set up some web applications using Kubernetes. In my free time I practice with the 
UCSB Ultimate Frisbee team, Black Tide, play guitar, and play videogames. A couple video games that I have spent a long time playing are Dota 2, Rocket League,
Overwatch, and Minecraft. If we have any similar interests, be it in the computer science world, extracurriculars, or anything else, feel free to come to me 
during office hours and chat about that as well! For example, if you are looking for inspiration to start a computer science project, I love coming up with plans, and
detailing architectures to get a project off the ground!
