Hi everyone and welcome!

My name is Tasha Shukla and I am currently a third-year studying Statistics and Data Science. I am very interested in the analytics behind the entertainment industry and hope one day to conduct data analysis or consumer insights for various entertainment companies. My favorite type of television to watch is any type of reality series.

Please never hesitate to reach out to me with any questions. I was very intimidated taking this course because I had no previous Python experience. With the help of Prof K. and the knowledgeable TA, this course became a lot less frightening. I took this during Winter 2020, right before COVID unleashed, and it set a great foundation for the rest of the coding classes I have taken. 

In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, family and being outdoors. I love a good walk on the beach or morning workout. I am also a food guru so I spend time finding new restaurants or recipes. Who doesnâ€™t love good food? My family and I are big travelers as well, so I am always looking to visit new places!

I am looking forward to getting to know all of you and I wish you the best in this course and beyond!
