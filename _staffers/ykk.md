Hi everyone! Welcome to CS190J! 
I am looking forward to working with all of you to help students make learning easier, more organized, and more engaging. 

I love getting to know my students, organizing fun social events, and drinking copious amounts of tea (sometimes, doing all of it simultaneously ;-)).
